The _statistical learning_ series records my journey toward understanding _function estimation from empirical data_.
{% include series.html %}

_Function estimation_ here refers to the following 3 generic problems:

* Pattern Recognition
* Regression
* Probability Distribution Estimation




likelihood method (Fisher, Gauss, Laplace, etc.)

What is the classical method (parametric paradigm)?

What is its assumptions?

How they fail in answering the coming questions (also what is your new coming question)?

What is the solution?

\\[\int_0^{+\infty} x^n e^{-x} \,dx = n! \\] 
Low dimensional function estimation paradigm

How they fail in high dimensional cases (curse of dimensionality)

Definition of dimensionality curse:

If a desired function has _s_ derivatives, then using polynomials with _N_ terms one can only guaranteee the accuracy of _O(N^{-s/n}_. 


The fork of parametric paradigm (particular inference) 
and  (general inference)

Weierstrass Theorem gives the mathematical explanation of Dimenisionality Curse, but restricted to polynomial form. Can you give a more general mathematical expression?
