The most comforting things for me are complicated systems grown out of well-organized principles. Good exmaples are smooth ball games, well-written music and softwares. Many of them seem awkward for outsiders. The only compensation for digging into them is the pleasure of appreciating them. Either you fail or success, you will always confirm your original intention. To learn something we need the irrational confidence and enthusim for it, that's where teacher takes the significant role.


Softwares are boost of modern society. One's software taste can tell a lot about what role he/she is playing. For me, my preference is formed by those who keep crystalizing and boasting their codes while criticizing others'. You will believe that every salesman or preacher has something to learn from Paul Graham or Steve Yegge after reading their books. As a member of this pyramid scales tribe, I try to sell something  bought from Linus here today. It is Git&Github.

There is literature about literature called literature critics, there is language about language called grammer or meta language. Interesting systems are very often self-supportive that we can't tell its start or end. In the bits' world, we have softwares that support the development of softwares.
