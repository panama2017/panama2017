My name is Baoxiang Pan. I am a Ph.D. Candidate in [CHRS \| Center for Hydrometeorology and Remote Sensing](http://chrs.web.uci.edu)  at [University of California, Irvine](http://uci.edu/). My research focused on sub seasonal to seasonal weather/climate forecast using both numerical and statistical models. I am interested in computer programming, drawing, playing guitar and basketball.
