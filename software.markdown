#### WRF

The [Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model](http://www.wrf-model.org/) is a next-generation mesoscale numerical weather prediction system designed for both atmospheric research and operational forecasting needs. It features two dynamical cores, a data assimilation system, and a software architecture facilitating parallel computation and system extensibility.  

I am using WRF-ARW to explore the influenct of sea surface temperature, sea level pressure and sea level altitude on the precipitation in west America Continent. 

#### Mathematica

Mathematica is an integrated mathematical computational developping environment developed by [Wolfram Research of Champaign, Illinois](http://www.wolfram.com/). For me, the most attractive feature of Mathematica is its functional programming paradigm, elegant grammer and built-in online weather gauge dataset access. These features also inspired me on developing similar libraries for other programming environments like python or matlab.

#### Python

I started to appreciate *Object Oriented* programming paradigm through using Python. Once an elegant API mechanism was provided, we can see how many libraries would flourish and how fast the community would grow. 

#### Lisp

Mathematica and Python try to decorate Lisp but are doomed to lose its dignity. If enough packages and high level functions were there, Lisp could be both my favourate and most-used treasure, or maybe not. Few things can make me kneel down as an adult, but for sure, Lisp is one of them.
